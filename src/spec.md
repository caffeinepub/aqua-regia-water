# Aqua Regia Water

## Current State
The website displays a plastic water bottle image with incorrect branding. The current bottle does not accurately represent the Aqua Regia brand name and is missing the key pricing/volume information (500ml at ₹9).

## Requested Changes (Diff)

### Add
- Add "500ml at ₹9" text/label on the bottle design

### Modify
- Replace the current water bottle image with a new plastic bottle that correctly displays "Aqua Regia" as the brand name
- Ensure the bottle design maintains the cyan and white color theme

### Remove
- Remove the existing incorrectly branded bottle image

## Implementation Plan
1. Generate a new plastic water bottle image with correct "Aqua Regia" branding
2. Include "500ml" and "₹9" pricing information on the bottle label
3. Maintain cyan and white color scheme throughout the bottle design
4. Replace the existing bottle image in the frontend assets

## UX Notes
The updated bottle should clearly communicate:
- Brand identity: "Aqua Regia" prominently displayed
- Volume: 500ml clearly visible
- Price point: ₹9 emphasized as a key selling point
- Visual consistency with the cyan and white brand theme
